It uses a peer to peer distribuion system across a cluster of nodes where each nodes is able to communicate with other nodes in the cluster without needing a master node. Cassandra is also able to provide linear scalability and designed to be fault tolerant. CQL is the quary language to interact with Cassandra. Similarly to SQL and provides syntax for creating tables, inserting data, querying data and managing the database schema."
